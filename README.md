Project Name:Waste Management System
Discription:Create a database to manage waste collection, disposal sites, and schedules.
   - Key Tasks:
     - Write SQL queries to generate collection schedules for specific areas.
     - Use PL/SQL functions to calculate disposal site utilization.
     - Implement triggers to track missed collections and notify managers.
The Waste Management System is designed to manage waste collection, disposal sites, and schedules. It includes the following key tasks:

Collection Schedules: It generates collection schedules for specific areas based on factors like population density and disposal site availability.

Disposal Site Utilization: It calculates the utilization rate of disposal sites by comparing the amount of waste processed to the site's capacity, helping manage resources efficiently.

Tracking Missed Collections: The system tracks missed collections due to various reasons and notifies managers, enabling them to take corrective actions promptly.

Overall, the system optimizes waste collection by automating schedule generation, monitoring disposal site usage, and sending alerts for missed collections, leading to improved efficiency and resource management in waste management operations.
